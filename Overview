# Happy Birthday Display – Verilog Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates a "Happy Birthday" message display using Verilog HDL.
The focus is on FSM-based character sequencing and 7-segment encoding.
This version is verified through simulation only and has not been deployed on FPGA hardware.

## Features
- FSM-controlled message sequencing
- 7-segment display encoding
- Clock divider for visible timing
- Modular Verilog design
- Testbench-based verification

## Simulation Environment
- Simulator: ModelSim / Vivado Simulator
- Timescale: 1ns / 1ps

## Simulation Results
Waveforms confirming correct character sequencing are provided in the `sim/` directory.

## Project Status
✔ Simulation complete  
✘ FPGA deployment (pending)

## Learning Outcomes
- Designing FSMs in Verilog
- Writing structured testbenches
- Understanding clock division in simulation
- Modular HDL design

## Future Work
- FPGA deployment on Spartan-6
- Real-time 7-segment display verification
- Optional buzzer or scrolling text support
